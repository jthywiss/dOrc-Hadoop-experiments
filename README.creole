= dOrc-Hadoop-experiments =

Experiments on Hadoop/HDFS for comparison with d-Orc

== Overview ==

This directory tree contains a Hadoop application that counts words in files, written in standard Java.
This application is for comparison with the d-Orc {{{wordcount}}} performance test item.


== What's in This Directory Tree ==

* An Eclipse project with Java source and build scripts.
* The Hadoop 2.7.7 distribution for Linux, without the documentation.
* Utilities to load data into HDFS and run the tests.
* An R script to plot the elapsed times of the experimental trials.


== To Install and Run ==

# Pick a set of target Linux machines you will run HDFS and the tests on.  Pick one as the "leader" host.
# Configure any settings in the {{{hadoop-2.7.7/etc/hadoop}}} directory.  Notably, set the list of {{{slaves}}} and {{{slaves.all}}}, and the settings in {{{core-site.xml}}} and {{{hdfs-site.xml}}}.
# Copy the Hadoop distribution in {{{hadoop-2.7.7}}} to all of your target machines.
# Set the {{{HADOOP_PREFIX}}} environment variable on all of your target machines to the location of the Hadoop distribution.
# Add {{{$HADOOP_PREFIX/sbin:$HADOOP_PREFIX/bin}}} to your PATH on all of your target machines.
# Run the Eclipse build.  (The Eclipse projects {{{OrcScala}}}, {{{OrcSites}}}, {{{OrcTests}}}, and {{{PorcE}}} are needed to build {{{dOrc-Hadoop-experiments}}}.)  The Eclipse build:
## Builds the Java files, and
## Bundles them into the {{{dOrc-Hadoop-experiments.jar}}} JAR in the {{{build}}} directory.
# Copy the {{{dOrc-Hadoop-experiments.jar}}} JAR to the leader host.
# Place a single copy of the input test data file somewhere on the leader host.
# Run the {{{tools/format-load-dfs.sh}}} shell script on the leader host, to replicate the input test data file to HDFS.
# Run the {{{tools/run-wordcount.sh}}} shell script on the leader host, to actually run the app.
# Output and logs will be in {{{raw-output}}}.
# Run the {{{tools/clobber-dfs.sh}}} shell script on the leader host, to clean up the HDFS processes and files.
# Run the R script:
## TODO: Take my scratch script that does these steps and generalize so that others can run it.
## Create {{{experimental-conditions.csv}}}
## Run {{{java -cp "${ORC_HOME}"OrcScala/lib/scala-library.jar:"${ORC_HOME}"OrcTests/build/ orc.test.util.RunResultsTableMerge . repetition-times >"${ANALYSIS_DIR}"repetition-times.csv}}}
## Copy {{{analysis.R}}}, {{{plotElapsedTimeHadoop.R}}}, {{{repetition-times.csv}}} to a scratch directory.
## In the scratch directory, run {{{Rscript plotElapsedTimeHadoop.R }}}//{{{run_number}}}//, where //{{{run_number}}}// is used in the graph's title.
## Copy {{{*.pdf}}} from the scratch directory to {{{analysis_elapsedTime}}}.
## Remove the scratch directory.
